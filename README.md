# Aspect Marketplace Project

## Overview
Aspect Marketplace is a React-based web application that enables users to connect their Ethereum wallets and manage aspects. The platform allows for the listing of various aspects, each with its name and description, and provides functionality to add these aspects to users' wallets. A key feature includes the ability to bind aspects using contract addresses and ABI files, enhancing the user experience in the Ethereum ecosystem.
