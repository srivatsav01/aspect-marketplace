# Aspect Marketplace Project

## Use Case Summary
Aspect Marketplace is a React-based web application that enables users to connect their Ethereum wallets and manage aspects. The platform allows for the listing of various aspects, each with its name and description, and provides functionality to add these aspects to various contracts. A key feature includes the ability to bind aspects using contract addresses and ABI files, enhancing the user experience in the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Team Members and Roles
- **Srivatsav** - Core Developer

## Features
- **Connect Wallet**: Users can connect their Ethereum wallets to interact with the marketplace.
- **List Aspects**: Display a list of aspects with their names and descriptions.
- **Add Aspects**: Users can add aspects to their contracts by providing contract addresses and ABI files.


## Problem Addressed
This project addresses the need for a user-friendly interface that allows Ethereum users to easily manage and add aspects to their accounts. It simplifies the process of interacting with Ethereum smart contracts and enhances the overall user experience in managing decentralized assets and functionalities.

## Project Design and Implementation
The Aspect Marketplace is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, ensuring ease of use even for those new to decentralized applications. The project structure is as follows:

- **Connect Wallet Component**: Manages the connection to Ethereum wallets.
- **Aspect List Component**: Displays the available aspects.
- **Add Aspect Modal Component**: Handles the addition of new aspects, including the input of contract addresses and ABI files.

## Usage
To use the Aspect Marketplace, follow these steps:
1. Connect your Ethereum wallet using the "Connect Wallet" button.
2. Browse the list of available aspects.
3. Click on "Add Aspect" and add the required contract address and upload the ABI file in the modal.
4. Confirm the transaction and wait for the success confirmation.

Currently i've had some ideas which i haven't got time to implement that i've included on the website

- **Price Aspect**: Reverts transactions if token value falls below threshold, ensuring multisig wallet security despite signing delays.
- **Hack Aspect**: Checks if a specific address is of student or not else it reverts(i've previously implemented a similar project so this would be an extension of that https://ethglobal.com/showcase/educlaim-your-digital-academic-identity-a0ki5)
- **Student Aspect**: Handles the addition of new aspects, including the input of contract addresses and ABI files.
